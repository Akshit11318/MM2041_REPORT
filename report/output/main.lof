Water \textcolor {red}{(red)} is injected at the inlet, triggering viscous fingering due to a high mobility ratio, $\mu _{\text {oil}} / \mu _{\text {water}} = 3000$. Snapshots at 80\,s, 320\,s, 480\,s, and 640\,s show the progression and growth of the instability. Gravity effects are neglected and a surface tension coefficient of 0.006\,N/m is used.\relax }}{2}{figure.caption.1}%
